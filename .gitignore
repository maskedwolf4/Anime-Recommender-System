# DVC metadata files (*.dvc) MUST NOT BE IGNORED by Git.
# If you have a general ignore like `*.dvc`, you MUST negate it.
# The most common DVC setup is to *not* have `*.dvc` in .gitignore at all,
# and let DVC itself manage the specific .gitignore entries for the *data files*.
# If you absolutely need a blanket ignore for .dvc, then:
# !*.dvc # <--- Keep this if you have other blanket .dvc ignores, but it's generally not needed.
